# FVMC
FVMC (Football Vector Mega-Collection) is a constantly changing repository of football club vectors from all over the world. 

But what is a vector?
It's basically an image, but made with math. This means that it doesn't lose quality when zoomed in. These come in many file type (This collections uses .svg) and you can convert vectors to PNGs or JPEGs in any resolution. Vectors are also way lighter than any other image file.
